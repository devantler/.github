# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Reporting Issues

If you've found a problem or have a feature idea, please create an issue. This allows me to discuss the problem or feature before you start working on it.

## Making Changes

To make changes, you'll need to create your own copy of the repository (known as a 'fork') and make your changes there. Once you're done, you can submit these changes to me by creating a 'pull request'.

Here are the steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch in your fork with a name that describes your change.
3. Make your changes in this branch.
4. Submit a pull request from this branch.

## Code Standards

I aim to maintain high-quality code. To help with this, I follow certain coding standards and use tools for formatting and testing. Please ensure your contributions adhere to these standards. All required standards are checked in the CI/CD pipeline, so you'll know if your changes don't meet the standards by checking the status of your pull request.

## Pull Requests

Once you've submitted a pull request, I'll review your changes. I may suggest some changes or improvements. Pull requests can only be merged once they're approved and all tests pass.

## Keeping Your Changes Up to Date

While you're working on your changes, other people may submit updates to the project. You'll need to keep your fork up to date with these changes to avoid conflicts. You can do this by 'pulling' the latest changes from the upstream repository into your fork.

## Thank You
